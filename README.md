# SLAM-PROJECT ##Matlab ##ROS
Mobile robot has the ability to localize itself using a method called EKF Localization, but this is only true when a map of the environment is known [1]. Where as, a method to construct a map of the environment and localise relative to the map called SLAM (Simultaneously localisation Mapping) and it will be based on EKF. The Kalman filter based approaches are not very popular today anymore for solving the slam problem because they have some disadvantages especially with respect to computational complexity and expensiveness but they are still often used for if you only have a shorter map of the environment [2].In this project, We will see experimental SLAM we’ve built in based on algorithm defined in this project at University West for the fulfillment of a graduate course called Service Robotics. Full paper disclosed.
